/**
 * Encrypted PDFs, in both directions: the size cap, the password rules, the
 * permission rules, the queue, the deadline, the re-protection contract, and
 * every message a caller can see.
 *
 * The QPDF runtime itself is not loaded here. It runs in a worker thread —
 * `server/qpdf-decrypt-worker.js`, the only module in the tree that loads it —
 * which this module starts, drives, bounds and destroys. See that file for why
 * the work cannot run on the calling thread; see below for what this module
 * decides.
 *
 * pdf-lib 1.17.1 cannot decrypt anything, so every tool that goes through it
 * fails on an encrypted document no matter what password the caller supplies.
 * This module is the way through, for two groups of tools with two different
 * rules:
 *
 *   - the read-only tools `read_pdf_fields`, `validate_pdf` and
 *     `extract_to_csv`, which never write a PDF back; and
 *   - the mutation tools in `ENCRYPTED_WRITE_OPERATIONS`, which do, and which
 *     therefore also have to put the document's protection back afterwards.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * It is not a "remove the password" facility, and there is no parameter that
 * turns it into one. QPDF will decrypt an owner-locked document — one that
 * opens with an empty user password but whose `/P` denies modification —
 * without any password at all, and will re-lock it afterwards with an
 * identical `/P` and `/R`. Shipping that shape would make PDF Tools a
 * permissions-circumvention tool. So decryption is gated:
 *
 *   - a caller who supplies a password that the document accepts is acting on
 *     a credential they already hold, and proceeds *for a read*; but
 *   - a caller who supplies none, and merely benefits from the document's
 *     empty user password, proceeds only if the document's own `/P` grants the
 *     permission the operation needs, and is otherwise refused by name.
 *
 * The empty string counts as *no password*, so the check above cannot be
 * sidestepped by passing `""` to a document whose user password is empty.
 *
 * The gates are evaluated here, between the worker's two phases. The worker
 * reports what the document says about itself and then waits; it is told to
 * decrypt only after this module has decided that it may. A refusal is
 * therefore a refusal to do the work, not a decision to throw the result away.
 *
 * ## Reads and writes are gated differently, on purpose
 *
 * For a read, holding either password makes the caller the intended reader and
 * that is the end of it. For a write it is not. A document whose `/P` says
 * `modify: not allowed` is making an explicit statement about what may be done
 * to it, and the owner password is precisely the credential that exists to
 * authorise overriding that statement. So on the write path a *user* password
 * does not satisfy a permission the document denies: only the owner password
 * does, and authenticating as owner satisfies permissions by definition.
 *
 * Note that QPDF keeps reporting a document's declared capabilities as denied
 * even when the owner password matched, so the owner check has to be made
 * against `ownerPasswordMatched` rather than read out of the capabilities.
 *
 * ## Protection in, protection out
 *
 * A write path never changes a document's protection. After pdf-lib has
 * produced the modified bytes, `reprotectPdfAfterWrite` restores the original
 * `/Encrypt` with QPDF's `--copy-encryption`, which reproduces `/O`, `/OE`,
 * `/U`, `/UE`, `/P`, `/R`, `/V`, `/ID` and the crypt filters verbatim —
 * including an owner password nothing here ever learned. The result is then
 * compared against the source's own protection, digest of the literal
 * `/Encrypt` dictionary included, before the bytes are allowed anywhere near
 * disk. Silent protection change is the failure this path exists to prevent,
 * so it is asserted against rather than assumed away.
 *
 * There is deliberately no fallback. A document that cannot be faithfully
 * re-protected fails the operation and writes nothing; an encrypted input
 * yields an encrypted output or no output at all.
 *
 * ## Which permission bit
 *
 * The read tools require `extract` — `/P` bit 5, "copy or otherwise extract
 * text and graphics". Every one of them copies document content out of the
 * document: `read_pdf_fields` returns field names and their current values,
 * `validate_pdf` reports field names and whether each is filled, and
 * `extract_to_csv` writes field values to a CSV file on disk. That is
 * extraction under any reading of the bit.
 *
 * Two nearby bits are deliberately *not* accepted as substitutes:
 *
 *   - `accessibility` (bit 10) is almost always granted and would make the
 *     check vacuous. It authorizes extraction for assistive technology, and
 *     nothing here can establish that the caller is assistive technology.
 *   - `modifyforms` (bit 9) authorizes filling a form, not reading what is
 *     already in it. A document may permit filling while denying extraction,
 *     and honouring `modifyforms` here would hand back the values that
 *     `extract` was set to withhold.
 *
 * The mutation tools each require the bit that matches what they actually do
 * to the file; see `ENCRYPTED_WRITE_OPERATIONS` for the mapping and why each
 * one is what it is.
 *
 * ## Memory
 *
 * QPDF-WASM costs roughly 16x the input size plus a ~45 MB baseline, which is
 * why encrypted inputs get their own explicit, much lower size cap
 * (`PDF_ENCRYPTED_MAX_FILE_BYTES`) instead of the 250 MiB mutation cap. See the
 * constant for those measurements.
 *
 * Isolation was expected to improve on that, on the theory that a heap dying
 * with its thread would be returned where an in-process collection was not. It
 * does not, and the measurements say so plainly. On macOS/arm64, after a single
 * 14.6 MiB decrypt and a forced-GC settle:
 *
 *   | arrangement | peak RSS | settled RSS | retained over baseline |
 *   | ----------- | -------: | ----------: | ---------------------: |
 *   | in-process  |   333 MB |      243 MB |                 188 MB |
 *   | worker      |   315 MB |      315 MB |                 260 MB |
 *
 * Destroying the thread returns *less* than collecting the module did: the
 * freed pages stay mapped in the process, so `terminate()` buys nothing here
 * and costs about 70 MB of resting RSS. What neither arrangement does is
 * accumulate — eight consecutive near-cap decrypts plateau at 373 MB
 * in-process and 352 MB in workers rather than summing, because each new
 * worker reuses the pages the last one released. So the per-file cap remains
 * sufficient and `extract_to_csv` still needs no aggregate bound.
 *
 * The deadline is what isolation actually buys. The memory column is a cost,
 * and a small one against the 1024 MiB budget, but it is not a saving and must
 * not be read as one; see the size constant.
 *
 * ## Plaintext handling
 *
 * Decrypted bytes exist only in memory and are never written to disk. They also
 * never leave the process that asked for them: the worker is a thread, and the
 * plaintext reaches this module through `postMessage`'s transfer list, which
 * moves ownership of the same pages rather than serializing them. Nothing is
 * copied, piped, or staged to a file.
 *
 * This module runs in two hosts, and the property holds in both. For a read it
 * runs in the server process. For a mutation it runs inside the isolated
 * pdf-lib child, which is where the decrypt/mutate/re-protect sequence has to
 * live: that child stages its output to a file on disk, so protection must be
 * restored before staging, which puts QPDF in the child — and once QPDF is
 * there, decrypting there too means the plaintext never crosses a process
 * boundary either. Passing plaintext from the server to the child would have
 * given up exactly the property this design was built to keep.
 *
 * The caller gets a `release()` and must call it once it has finished reading
 * the loaded document. Be honest about what that buys: `release()` overwrites
 * the Node buffer it handed out, but JavaScript cannot guarantee erasure. The
 * garbage collector may already have copied the buffer, and any of those pages
 * may have been written to swap. This reduces the window in which plaintext is
 * readable in the process; it does not eliminate it. The WebAssembly heap's own
 * copies are a smaller problem than they were, because the thread holding them
 * is destroyed at the end of every request.

/**
 * The per-file ceiling for an encrypted input, deliberately separate from and
 * far below `PDF_MUTATION_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (250 MiB), which must not govern
 * this path.
 *
 * Measured against this runtime on macOS/arm64, decrypting costs a peak RSS of
 * roughly `16 x input + 45 MB`:
 *
 *   |  input | peak RSS delta |
 *   | -----: | -------------: |
 *   | 1.0 MB |          52 MB |
 *   | 7.3 MB |         162 MB |
 *   | 14.6MB |         272 MB |
 *   | 29.2MB |         472 MB |
 *
 * At 16 MiB the decrypt peak is about 300 MB, and the plaintext then has to be
 * parsed by pdf-lib on top of that, landing the whole read comfortably inside
 * the 1024 MiB that `PDF_LIB_RSS_MAXIMUM_BYTES` already treats as the point
 * where a PDF operation has consumed too much. Doubling the cap to 32 MiB
 * would put the decrypt alone near 560 MB and the full read past 700 MB, with
 * no useful margin; that is the reason for the specific number rather than a
 * rounder, larger one.
 *
 * Isolation did not change any of that, and specifically did not earn a larger
 * number. The peak of a single decrypt is what this cap is derived from, and
 * the measurements in the module header put the worker's peak at 315 MB against
 * 333 MB in-process — a few percent, not a factor. Repeated decryption still
 * plateaus rather than accumulating, so `extract_to_csv` still needs no
 * aggregate bound, but that was true before as well. Raising the cap would
 * raise the peak against the same 1024 MiB budget, with nothing new to pay for
 * it.
