// The repository paths whose bytes reach the published Agent Plugin.
//
// This list is the whole discriminating power of `check-plugin-freshness.mjs`:
// that gate diffs `published..HEAD` and reports "nothing to publish" when no
// changed file matches an entry here. A path that ships and is missing from
// this list therefore produces a confident green over a stale distribution
// repo, which is the exact failure (#125) the gate was built to end.
//
// It lived as a private const inside the checker, under a comment that told
// maintainers to "keep this in step with scripts/build-agent-plugin.mjs".
// Nothing enforced that, and it had drifted: six inputs that demonstrably
// reach the artifact were absent. It is a module now so
// `test/plugin-freshness-coverage.test.js` can derive the true set from the
// builders and fail when the two disagree, in both directions.
//
// Two kinds of entry, and the difference matters when adding one:
//
//   1. DATA copied verbatim into the artifact (server/, vendor/, README.md).
//      Changing the file changes the published bytes directly.
//   2. BUILD CODE that decides what is copied or generates a shipped file
//      (scripts/build-mcpb.mjs, package-for-friend.js). Changing it can change
//      the published bytes with no change to any file in group 1 — which is
//      why "the builders themselves ship" is not a technicality.
//
// A false STALE costs one republish, which is idempotent. A false FRESH ships
// bytes nobody can reproduce. When in doubt, add the path.
