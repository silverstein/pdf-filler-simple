/**
 * The bill has to say what its contents are licensed under.
 *
 * `SBOM.cdx.json` emitted a `licenses` entry only when `package-lock.json`
 * happened to record a `license` field, which it does for fewer than half of
 * the locked packages. Seventy of a hundred and twelve components were named,
 * versioned and hashed while saying nothing at all about their terms, and that
 * inventory shipped in both the MCPB and the share ZIP.
 *
 * The two sides of every check below are deliberately different sources:
 *
 *   - the expectation for WHICH packages owe licence evidence is derived from
 *     `package-lock.json`, never from a count written down here;
 *   - the expectation for WHAT each one declares is re-read from the installed
 *     tree in `node_modules/`, while the committed record was resolved from
 *     the registry tarballs. A record that has been hand-edited, or a
 *     dependency bumped without regenerating it, disagrees with the code on
 *     disk and fails here.
 *
 * The last group proves the checks are not vacuous by mutating the lock and
 * the record in the ways a real change would, and requiring each mutation to
 * fail closed.
