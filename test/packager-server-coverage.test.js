/**
 * The packagers' server allow-lists against the real contents of `server/`.
 *
 * Both packagers name the server modules they ship explicitly, which is the
 * right default — a directory walk would let an untracked scratch file reach a
 * shipped artifact. The failure mode of an allow-list is the opposite one, and
 * it is silent: a module added to `server/` and imported by another module,
 * but never added to the list, is simply absent from the archive. Every
 * structural check downstream still passes, because each of them compares the
 * staged tree against the same short list, and the omission only surfaces when
 * a host starts the extension and Node cannot resolve the import.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened to `server/type3-cm-pk-reference.js`: three
 * separate allow-lists and one hand-written copy step never gained it, the
 * MCPB build reported success, and `npm run test:contract:share` died at
 * connection setup. These assertions make the lists derivable facts rather
 * than remembered ones.
