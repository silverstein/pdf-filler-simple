// Fault injection for the embedded-host native-canvas guard.
//
// The suite this replaces asserted the policy function against marker files the
// test wrote itself. That never ran the guard, so it could not have caught the
// defect that got the win32 default reverted: the guard cleared its marker the
// instant dlopen returned, covering only the link step while the risk it exists
// for is the first draw. A test that only writes markers and reads policy agrees
// with that bug completely.
//
// So everything here drives the real guarded process.dlopen with an injected
// loader, and asserts on the marker the guard actually left on disk.
