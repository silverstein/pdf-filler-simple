// Binds SHIPPED_PATHS to what the plugin build actually copies.
//
// scripts/check-plugin-freshness.mjs is the only mechanism that notices the
// distribution repo has gone stale. It decides by matching changed files
// against SHIPPED_PATHS, so a shipped input missing from that list makes the
// gate print "nothing to publish" and exit 0 over a stale published plugin —
// a false green from the one thing watching. The list carried a comment
// telling maintainers to keep it in step with the builder by hand, and nothing
// checked that, which is the shape of an unfollowable control: present,
// reassuring, and constraining nothing.
//
// These tests derive the shipped set from the builders themselves and assert
// it against the list in both directions. Both directions are load-bearing:
// a missing entry is a silent stale publish, and a dead entry makes the list
// look more complete than it is.
//
// Every derivation below is anchored so that a parse which stops matching
// throws instead of quietly deriving an empty set and passing vacuously.
