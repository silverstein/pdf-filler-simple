/**
 * The first integration of the vendored QPDF WebAssembly runtime: decryption
 * for the three read-only tools that never write a PDF back.
 *
 * The property under test is not "encrypted PDFs can now be read". It is the
 * narrower one the feature was scoped to: a caller who holds a credential the
 * document accepts gets through, and a caller who merely benefits from an
 * empty user password does not get more than the document's own `/P` grants.
 * The owner-locked shape — opens freely, denies modification, and can be
 * decrypted, edited and re-locked by qpdf with no password at all — is the
 * one this feature must not become a tool for, so it is tested from both
 * sides: denied when `/P` withholds extraction, allowed when `/P` grants it.
 *
 * Fixtures are encrypted here rather than committed, using the same runtime
 * the product uses, so the suite exercises real AES-256, AES-128 and RC4-128
 * documents without adding binaries to the tree.
