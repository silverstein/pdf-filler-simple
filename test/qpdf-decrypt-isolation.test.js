/**
 * The containment around decryption: a wall-clock deadline that genuinely
 * stops the work, and a server that stays answerable while a hostile document
 * is being chewed on.
 *
 * The exposure this suite exists for is specific. QPDF-WASM's `callMain` is
 * synchronous, so on the thread that calls it nothing else runs — no timer, no
 * incoming request — until it returns. The 16 MiB cap on encrypted inputs
 * bounds *bytes*, and QPDF's cost tracks *objects*, which are nearly free per
 * byte. The fixture below is the demonstration: a valid, well under-cap
 * encrypted PDF whose object count alone buys seconds of uninterruptible
 * compute. Run in the server process, that is seconds during which every tool
 * is dead, and there is no reason to think the fixture is the worst case.
 *
 * So the assertions here are about termination rather than about detection. A
 * deadline that only rejects a promise while the work keeps running would pass
 * a naive timing test and fix nothing, which is why the CPU-flatline assertion
 * exists and why the responsiveness test talks to the real MCP server rather
 * than to the module.
 *
 * The fixture is generated here, from the runtime the product uses, rather than
 * committed: it exists to be pathological, and a pathological PDF is not
 * something to add to the tree.
