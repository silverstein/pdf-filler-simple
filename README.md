# PDF Tools for Claude Desktop and Local MCP Hosts

The local PDF workflow for Claude Desktop and MCP hosts: fill, sign, merge,
split, extract, render, and analyze PDFs with local file operations.

Instead of just opening a PDF, PDF Tools lets Claude fetch PDF URLs to your
machine, inspect documents visually, fill forms, save reusable profiles, add
signature/date zones, merge and split files, reorganize pages visually, extract
structured data, and return document content to your chosen MCP host for analysis.

This package targets Claude Desktop and other local MCP hosts today. It does not yet include a remote connector for Claude Cowork / web-hosted Claude.

## Install

### Claude Desktop

1. **[Download the latest `.mcpb` from Releases](https://github.com/Open-Document-Alliance/PDF-Tools/releases/latest)**
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file to install it in Claude Desktop

The extension is also available in the Claude Extensions directory.

Claude Desktop settings include an **Allowed PDF Directories** field. By default,
PDF Tools can access `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`, and `~/Desktop`. Add any other
folder you want Claude to use before asking it to read, fill, sign, merge, or save
PDFs there. Saved profiles and signatures live in the extension's private local
store and do not need to be added manually.

### Cursor / Other MCP Hosts

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pdf-tools": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/PDF-Tools/server/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ChatGPT / Codex Agent Plugin

A fresh Agent Plugin install uses a private PDF Tools workspace. There is no
folder setup step: when the host is allowed to read a file, it can copy the file
into that workspace for PDF Tools to process. PDF Tools itself still refuses
direct paths outside the workspace.

This is a tool boundary, not a confidentiality boundary against the host. If
ChatGPT is set to Full Access, its broader filesystem permission governs what it
can import. Optional direct folder access can be configured separately in the
plugin's `config.json`; a non-empty list replaces the private workspace.

## Why It's Different

Claude already knows how to read PDFs in limited ways. PDF Tools goes much further:

- **Interactive viewer:** page navigation, zoom, search, fullscreen, text selection, and form-field sidebar
- **Form workflows:** `fill_pdf`, `read_pdf_fields`, `bulk_fill_from_csv`, and reusable profiles
- **Sign mode:** signature/date zone detection, saved or drawn local signatures, text stamping, inspect-region, preview-to-zone flows, and optional consent-gated Lumin e-signing
- **URL-to-PDF workflows:** fetch HTTP(S) PDF links to the local machine when sandboxed web fetches are blocked
- **Page organization:** merge, split, rotate, reorder, and apply full page plans in one pass
- **Extraction and analysis:** page-bounded reads, text search, page/region rendering, CSV export, page-level analysis, metadata, and validation
- **Verified extraction workspaces:** bind a PDF and JSON Schema, inspect source chunks, submit cited leaf proposals, and retain deterministic replay results without a model inside the MCP server
- **Local file operations:** PDF Tools reads, renders, edits, and saves files on your machine instead of uploading them to a separate PDF service
- **Scoped file operations:** PDF Tools directly reads and writes only its active folders; a host with broader filesystem permission may import files into the private plugin workspace

Text, images, and metadata returned by PDF Tools may be processed by Claude or
another MCP host. Your host and model provider's data terms apply to that
content, so the complete workflow is not necessarily zero egress.

## What You Can Do

### Interactive PDF Viewer

- View PDFs with page navigation, zoom, search, and fullscreen
- Select and copy text directly from pages
- See form fields in a sidebar with fill status
- Use visual page management to reorder, rotate, and remove pages before saving a new copy

### URL-to-PDF Workflows

- Download PDFs from HTTP(S) URLs to your local machine
- Open downloaded PDFs immediately in the viewer for fill, sign, page management, extraction, or analysis
- Use the local MCP host for cases where Claude's normal web/proxy fetch path cannot retrieve the PDF
- Keep downloaded PDFs inside user-approved local directories

### Forms and Reusable Profiles

- Fill W-9s, 1099s, rental applications, waivers, and any fillable PDF
- Save personal or business details as reusable profiles
- List, load, and apply saved profiles so repeated forms take seconds instead of minutes
- Bulk fill many PDFs from CSV data and validate required fields before submission

### Sign Mode and Local Signatures

- Detect likely signature, initials, printed-name, and date zones with model-readable coordinates
- Switch to the viewer's Sign tab to place signatures, dates, or text on detected zones
- Draw or reuse saved local signatures
- Inspect a region, preview it, and turn it into a typed signing zone when automatic detection is not enough
- Prepare a provider-neutral handoff receipt that binds the exact local input/output, typed zones, participant roles, page geometry, and unresolved inputs without contacting a signing provider
- Keep signing edits local, with active-document tracking and backup behavior for same-file mutations
- Optionally connect a Lumin account with browser-based PKCE, preview the exact recipients and disclosure locally, and send the prepared PDF only after the user confirms the exact sending statement
- Check an existing Lumin request by polling and download an agreement or completion certificate without exposing the temporary signed URL or replacing an existing local file

### Optional Lumin e-signing

Lumin e-signing is an explicit external workflow. The rest of PDF Tools stays
local-first. PDF Tools contacts Lumin only when a Lumin tool is called. Sending
requires a provider-ready `prepare_signing_packet` receipt, a local preview, a
connected Lumin session, and the user's fresh verbatim confirmation. The
prepared PDF plus listed names and email addresses then leave the device and are
handled by Lumin.

PDF Tools can validate the exact confirmation text and its freshness, but it
cannot independently prove who typed it. The MCP host must present the
destructive tool action, and the agent must pass only the user's actual words
and time. Agents must never fabricate either value.

Configure a public OAuth client ID in the extension's **Lumin OAuth Client ID**
setting. Other stdio hosts may set `LUMIN_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`; Agent Plugin users
may set `luminOAuthClientId` in the plugin's private `config.json`. Register the
exact redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1/callback`. The OAuth access token stays only
in the running PDF Tools process. It is not returned, logged, or written to
disk, and a restart requires connecting again.

The create call is one-shot and has no automatic retry. If the provider outcome
is uncertain, PDF Tools preserves that uncertainty and will not create another
request under the same authority. Status polling is the current desktop path.
Lumin app webhooks require a private server app and are not part of this public
PKCE workflow. The durable signing-operation store currently supports macOS and
Linux. The public Lumin workflow fails closed on Windows until a reviewed
ACL-aware state adapter exists.

### Page Organization Tools

- Merge multiple PDFs into one document
- Split PDFs by exact page ranges or regular intervals
- Rotate and reorder pages
- Apply a full page plan in one pass to reorder, rotate, and delete pages while preserving the original

### Extraction and Analysis

- Read existing PDF text layers for summarization, question answering, and research workflows
- Extract structured data to CSV
- Inspect page-level details like orientation, text presence, images, and likely blank pages
- Review source-bound page geometry, bounded metadata, form widgets, ordinary annotations, and file identity
- Inspect exactly eight shallow catalog-level accessibility signals with explicit missing or unavailable states and required human review
- Build a private schema-bound extraction workspace, cite source chunks, and retain exact, computed, ambiguous, not-found, or failed verification states without numeric confidence

See [Verified extraction workspaces](docs/VERIFIED_EXTRACTION.md) for the
complete lifecycle, supported methods, privacy boundary, and current limits.

PDF Tools does not currently bundle an OCR engine. Text reads use the PDF.js
text layer. If the selected `read_pdf_content` result contains no text, the tool
may return a rendered image of page 1 for vision-capable host/model inspection.
Page and region rendering produces raster images, not recognized text. A mixed
text/raster PDF, or raster pages after page 1, may therefore contain content the
broad text read does not recognize. Optional local OCR remains a planned
improvement rather than a shipped capability.

`get_pdf_info` binds these observations to the exact race-aware source
SHA-256, keeps widget annotations separate from ordinary annotations, and
returns link or action targets only as inert values. Page and region renders
report page geometry, coordinate spaces, renderer policy, the PNG SHA-256,
and raw RGBA SHA-256 availability.

`inspect_pdf_accessibility` is a bounded structural-review screen for an
unencrypted local PDF. It does not run veraPDF, assess tag semantics or
assistive-technology behavior, or establish PDF/UA, WCAG, certification,
legal, or document-accessibility conclusions.

Region-render inputs are top-left PDF.js viewport points after CropBox,
rotation, and UserUnit. They are not MediaBox-relative signing-zone
coordinates. The macOS Quick Look fallback renders whole pages and regions in
that same view and reports raw pixels unavailable.

## Great Fit For

### Common Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:ui
npm run smoke:ui-dev
npm run smoke:ui-sign
npm run smoke:ui-inspect
npm run smoke:ui-preview-zone
npm run smoke:ui-draw
npm run smoke:mcpb -- pdf-toolkit-mcp.mcpb
npm run build:ui
npm run build:mcpb
npm test
npm run test:node-native
npm run test:all
node server/index.js
node package-for-friend.js
```

`npm test` runs the Vitest partition. Release qualification uses
`npm run test:all` so the explicitly classified Node native-test suites cannot
be silently omitted.

### Viewer Dev Mode

`npm run dev:ui` starts the Vite viewer with a mocked ext-apps host and a real local MCP subprocess behind `/__dev__/tool`.

- Default URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/?pdf_path=example-fw9.pdf`
- You can point at another file with `?pdf_path=/absolute/path/to/file.pdf`
- The dev bridge is serve-only; `npm run build:ui` still produces the production single-file viewer for packaging
- `npm run smoke:ui-dev` starts the dev server on a throwaway port, verifies the HTML loads, and round-trips a real `display_pdf` tool call through `/__dev__/tool`
- `npm run smoke:ui-sign` boots the dev server, opens a real browser session with `agent-browser`, switches to sign mode, and verifies a sign-panel interaction opens a signing modal
- `npm run smoke:ui-inspect` boots the dev server, opens a real browser session with `agent-browser`, switches to sign mode, arms inspect-region, drags a rectangle, and verifies the region preview modal opens
- `npm run smoke:ui-preview-zone` boots the dev server, opens a real browser session, drives inspect-region, creates a zone from the preview modal, and verifies the sign modal opens on that new custom zone
- `npm run smoke:ui-draw` boots the dev server, opens the draw-signature modal in a real browser session, sketches a small stroke, fills the save fields, and verifies the modal closes after saving

### Third-party notices

The MCPB and the share ZIP both carry a vendored QPDF WebAssembly runtime at
`vendor/qpdf-wasm/runtime/`. No tool loads it yet; it is packaged ahead of the
integration that will use it. qpdf is Apache-2.0, and the complete notice set
(qpdf, zlib, libjpeg-turbo, the Emscripten generated runtime, musl,
compiler-rt, libc++, libc++abi and libunwind) ships beside it in
`vendor/qpdf-wasm/runtime/licenses/`, bound to its SHA-256 hashes by
`licenses/manifest.json`. The npm dependencies keep their own licences inside
`node_modules/`, including the PDF.js, Foxit and Liberation font notices.
